Array Techniques for queries:
For example, we do
q queries on an array like
1,2,3,4 is array and then l=0, r=2, x= 3,, do +3 from 0 to 2nd index
4,5,6,4, done 

so we can do it in Big O(1).
Add x to left array[left]+=x and subtract from array[right+1]-=x if within range.
Then just do prefix sum. 
1 2 3 4 5,, prefix sum is below
1 3 6 10 15



Another Technique:
Shots fired from left will be cancelled out by shots fired from right
Take xor at Left and Right+1
array[left]^=x and array[Right+1]^=x

Now after queries, similarly take Prefix xor of last array.
