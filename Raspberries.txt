Raspberries Concept:
K=5 
Numbers are 7,3 so we increased 3 to 5 by 2 times 

K=3 -> 30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51
7 4 1 -> 9 * 4 -> 36.. 
K = 2
9 7 7 3 9

if k divise any number in array then whole product of array is divisible by k


A number is divisible by 4 if it contains at least two factors of 2 (i.e., 
2
2
2 
2
 ).
Since 4 is 
2
2
2 
2
  and 8 is 
2
3
2 
3
 , both 4 and 8 already have enough factors of 2 to ensure that the product of the numbers in the array is divisible by 4.

One even number and if there
